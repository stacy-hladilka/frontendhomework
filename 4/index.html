    <h3 class="title">What would you like to know about cockatiels?</h3>
    <p class="article">
      There’s a reason why the cockatiel is one of the most popular companion
      birds — this slender Australian parrot can be both cuddly and bold.
      Cockatiels can also be curious and, at times, feisty. With a cockatiel in
      the house, you are likely to hear a repertoire of chirps and
      whistles. Cuddly, outgoing, and comical are just three reasons why the
      cockatiel is the No. 1 pet bird in America. Cockatiels are also talented
      whistlers, and male cockatiels in particular are known for their whistle
      serenades, which can be directed at their favored person, their favorite
      object or their mirror reflection. When not whistling or keeping
      themselves busy foraging for food and fun around the cage, cockatiels
      often enjoy spending their downtime snuggling on their favored person’s
      shoulder. A healthy, well-socialized cockatiel can make a great family pet
      and is also ideal for apartment living.
